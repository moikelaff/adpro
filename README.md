# Module 4: Test-Driven Development Reflection

## Reflection on TDD Workflow

### Question 1: Usefulness of TDD Flow

Based on Percival's (2017) self-reflective questions from "Principles and Best Practice of Testing," I found the Test-Driven Development workflow highly beneficial. The "test-first" approach provided a clear roadmap by establishing what gaps needed to be filled in my program design.

Writing tests before implementation offered several advantages:
- Created a precise vision of my objectives for each class
- Made the actual coding process more structured and focused
- Simplified refactoring efforts due to immediate feedback
- Ensured functionality aligned with requirements from the start

Initially, adapting to TDD was challenging since it reverses the traditional coding approach. However, as I progressed through the modules, I began to appreciate its methodical nature and the quality improvements it brings to development.

For future projects, I plan to:
- Develop more independent test suites
- Improve edge case coverage
- Focus on test readability
- Maintain high standards for refactorability

### Question 2: Application of F.I.R.S.T. Principles

My tests successfully followed the F.I.R.S.T. principles:

| Principle | Implementation | 
|-----------|----------------|
| **Fast** | Tests executed quickly with minimal build time |
| **Independent** | Each test functioned autonomously without execution order dependency |
| **Repeatable** | Tests produced consistent results without reliance on external systems or changing data |
| **Self-Validating** | Clear assertions provided unambiguous pass/fail results |
| **Timely** | All tests were written before implementing the actual code |

For future testing improvements, I will:
- Expand edge case coverage
- Enhance readability for other developers
- Further isolate tests to achieve complete independence
- Maintain efficiency while balancing comprehensive coverage
- Focus on microtest principles to keep test scope narrow and focused
